# Airline-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-Python
This project involves data cleaning and modification of an airline dataset using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries in Python. The goal of the project is to preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

### Data Cleaning
- **Removing Null Values:** We identified and removed rows with null values to ensure the dataset's integrity.
- **Handling Duplicate Entries:** Duplicate records were detected and removed to maintain data accuracy.
- **Converting Data Types:** Certain columns were converted to appropriate data types for further processing.

### Data Modification
- **Feature Engineering:** New features were created based on existing columns to provide additional insights.
- **Data Normalization:** The data was normalized to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Aggregation:** We aggregated data based on specific criteria to facilitate meaningful analysis.

### Visualization
- **Matplotlib:** We utilized Matplotlib to create various visualizations, such as:
  - Bar charts to show flight delays by airline.
  - Line charts to display trends in passenger numbers over time.
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy:** For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
